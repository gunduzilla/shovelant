#### Built like ðŸ§ˆ with Java in Android Studio using Git for version control
Find yourself immersed in the world of the angler: one of mystique, wonder, and 2048. Leave no stone unturned, no fish unfished. Come for the trawl, leave with the sagacity of a million suns.

## Inspiration
Inspired by the Angler's Alliance 8th period club and our love for fishing, our team set out to build a game incorporating all that we've learned through our computer science classes.

## What it does
Thus far, Shovel Ant 2.0 incorporates tower-defense aspects and fish into a loveable game with hours of fun. A dynamic game built for the smallest phone and the largest tablet, it grapples with some of the greater topics of philosophy while remaining relevant to a younger audience.

## How we built it
Using our team's collective knowledge of mobile development and Android Studio, we built it from the ground up with full-stack development and love.

## Challenges we ran into
Brainstorming ideas for our project and certain "distractions" we hit upon along the way.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Building the framework of an ever-expandable game, and having a teammate with art-skills rivaling Picasso.

## What we learned
Our team threw a lot of ideas on the table and elaborated on them while brainstorming, but got off topic rapidly when presented with "Butter Dog." Version control was a headache at first, but once we got better at delegating tasks, things got a lot smoother, like butter.
 
## What's next for Shovel Ant 2.0
The incorporation of a 2048-like game and a glossary/wiki for the game and characters within.
